# alx-files_manager

<p>This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.</p>

### The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:
- User authentication via a token
- List all files
- Upload a new file
- Change permission of a file
- View a file
- Generate thumbnails for images

<p>Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.</p>

### Enjoy!
